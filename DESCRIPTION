Description: The bunch of functions to simulate rainfall events based on fitted distribution and to calculate number of catchment overflows. You can fit Gamma, Pareto, Weibull, GEV, Log-normal and expontetial distribution to rainfall parameters (precipitation depth and time). In simulation you can set catchment area parameters like sealing and sewerage network density.
